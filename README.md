# The Pages

One of the first websites I created when started to code. The idea of this site is to be a landing page where someone can access all information on books.

**Link to project:** https://the-pages.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

This project is the first page I embarked on creating. As a avid book lover, I wanted to be a combination of sharing my reading journey and now I am trying to evolve it into a space to access information on any books the the user might require.

## Lessons Learned:

This is a work in progress and I would like to keep adding functions and functionality to this as I go.
I intend to plug in APIs to give users the ability to search for any book they require.
I want the page to act as a database of book character information as well.

## Examples:

Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

**Weather Radar:** https://github.com/elza-somu/Weather-App-React

**Movie Finder:** https://github.com/elza-somu/movie-finder
